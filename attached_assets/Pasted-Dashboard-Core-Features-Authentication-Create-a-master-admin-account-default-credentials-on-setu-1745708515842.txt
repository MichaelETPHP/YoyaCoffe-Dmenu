Dashboard Core Features:
Authentication:

Create a master admin account (default credentials on setup).

Secure login system (email/username + password).

Protect all admin routes (session/token-based authentication).

Menu Management:

Add Menu Item

Fields: Menu Name, Price, Category (select existing), Description, Image URL.

Validation: Ensure all fields are required; price must be numeric; image must be a valid URL.

Edit / Delete Menu Items.

Like/Dislike Counter:

Track and display Likes and Dislikes per menu item (integer counters).

Optionally expose an API to increment likes/dislikes from the frontend.

Category Management:

Add Category

Fields: Category Name (unique).

Validation: Cannot add a Menu without an existing Category.

Edit / Delete Categories.

Prevent deletion if a category is still linked to menu items.

UI/UX Requirements:

Design a clean, modern, mobile-friendly dashboard.

Focus on good UX (easy forms, intuitive flow, fast interactions).

Use responsive layouts (flexbox or grid).

Dashboard theme should match a professional coffee shop brand (warm colors, elegant fonts).

Backend & Database:

Database: Use MySQL hosted at Clever Cloud.

Connection Details:

MYSQL_ADDON_HOST = bv4nrmkvxh2cw24s5wwv-mysql.services.clever-cloud.com

MYSQL_ADDON_DB = bv4nrmkvxh2cw24s5wwv

MYSQL_ADDON_USER = uhl1gxcqhendkqpp

MYSQL_ADDON_PORT = 3306

MYSQL_ADDON_PASSWORD = b7yxfkB2viGbegsUcy52

Create necessary tables: users, categories, menu_items, likes_dislikes.

Use proper ORM or query builder for clean, secure database interactions (e.g., Prisma, Knex.js).

Technology Stack:

Backend: Node.js + Express (or a similar lightweight framework).

Frontend: SvelteKit (if fullstack) OR another simple admin template system if separated.

Security: Passwords must be hashed (e.g., bcrypt), SQL queries protected (parameterized).

Extra:

Provide proper error handling (with user-friendly messages).

Use toasts/alerts for actions like "Menu added successfully" or "Error: Please fill all fields."

Simple dashboard analytics (e.g., count total menus, total likes).
